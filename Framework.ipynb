    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using Frameworks:\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensures reliable prompt quality across different use cases\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent crafting prompts from scratch\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to adapt and reuse for similar tasks\n",
    "- **Clarity**: Provides clear structure for both humans and AI models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Creating Your Own Frameworks:\n",
    "1. Start with the 6 key components (Role, Goal, Context, Constraints, Output Format, Mechanics)\n",
    "2. Identify patterns in your most successful prompts\n",
    "3. Test and iterate based on results\n",
    "4. Document what works for future reference\n",
