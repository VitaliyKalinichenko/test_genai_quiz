Instructions: Generate a list of edge-case test scenarios for a password reset form in a banking web application. Steps: 1. Identify inputs typically used in password reset. 2. Consider unusual, invalid, or rare input values. 3. Describe what the system should do in response to each case. Expectation: The output should include at least 5 edge-case scenarios, each in bullet-point format with a short expected result. Narrowing: Exclude scenarios related to UI layout or styling. Focus only on input data, error handling, and backend validation.\"\n",

Adjustment: Focus on XPath selectors. Type of Output: Python code. Extras: Add short comments explaining each step.\"\n",
