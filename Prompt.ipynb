    "# Difference Between System Prompt and User Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between system prompt and user prompt lies in their role and purpose when interacting with AI models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt:\n",
    "- These are instructions for the AI model that define its behavior, role, and limitations\n",
    "- Set by developers or system administrators\n",
    "- Usually invisible to the end user\n",
    "- Contains basic operating rules, communication style, safety constraints\n",
    "- Acts throughout the entire session as fundamental context\n",
    "- Example: \"You are a helpful assistant who always responds politely and provides accurate information\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Prompt:\n",
    "- These are specific requests or tasks from the user\n",
    "- Entered directly by the user in each message\n",
    "- Contains questions, commands, or requests to perform certain actions\n",
    "- Can change with each new message\n",
    "- Example: \"Explain to me how photosynthesis works\" or \"Write a poem about spring\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interaction:\n",
    "System prompt works as a \"constitution\" for AI - establishing general operating principles, while user prompt is a specific task performed within these principles. System prompt ensures consistency in AI behavior, while user prompt determines the specific content of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, system prompt tells AI \"how to be,\" while user prompt tells it \"what to do.\""

    "# Software Testing Example\n",

    "Here's a practical example from the software testing field:\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Prompt for QA Assistant AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an experienced QA engineer with 10+ years of experience in web application testing.\n",
    "Your role is to help create test cases, analyze bugs, and testing plans.\n",
    "Always:\n",
    "- Think from the user's perspective\n",
    "- Consider different browsers and devices\n",
    "- Focus on edge cases\n",
    "- Follow IEEE 829 standards for documentation\n",
    "- Write test cases in format: Preconditions → Steps → Expected Result\n",
    "Never skip security and accessibility checks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Prompts (specific requests from tester):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *\"Create test cases for a registration form with fields: email, password, password confirmation\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *\"Analyze this bug report and suggest additional reproduction steps: 'Page freezes when uploading large file'\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *\"Create a checklist for regression testing after payment system update\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction Result:\n",
    "System prompt ensures that AI always responds as an experienced QA with adherence to professional standards, structured approach, and focus on quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "User prompt defines the specific task - whether creating test cases, analyzing bugs, or planning testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows getting professional, structured responses that meet QA industry standards, regardless of what specific task the tester poses."

    "# What is a Prompt in Simple Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **prompt** is simply a message or instruction you give to an AI to tell it what you want it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like talking to a smart assistant:\n",
    "- You ask a question → that's a prompt\n",
    "- You give a command → that's a prompt  \n",
    "- You describe a task → that's a prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples:\n",
    "- \"What's the weather today?\" ← prompt\n",
    "- \"Write me a story about a cat\" ← prompt\n",
    "- \"Help me fix this code\" ← prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "It's basically **input** that you give to get **output** from the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"prompt\" comes from the idea of \"prompting\" someone to do something - like when a teacher prompts a student to answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple formula:\n",
    "Your prompt → AI thinks → AI gives you an answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The better and clearer your prompt, the better answer you'll get from the AI. It's like giving good directions - the clearer you are about what you want, the more likely you'll get what you're looking for."

    "1. **Be specific** - Clear instructions get better results\n",
    "2. **Provide context** - Give background information when needed\n",
    "3. **Use examples** - Show what you want if it's complex\n",
